# An anlaysis on Stock Returns & Refactored Code
Performing an analysis on stock returns and improving the code

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine two sets of data on stock within two years. The first data will look at total volume traded and the second is to compare annual returns on the stock between two years (2017 and 2018). The project uses VBA scripting to create a macro that will run loops through the data to find total volumes traded as well as yearly returns for one of the two years. The second purpose of this project is to refactor the code and compare the new code to the original. The purpose of refactoring the code will be to improve efficiency and make the code better enabled to handle larger amounts of data.
