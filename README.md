# An anlaysis on Stock Returns & Refactored Code
Performing an analysis on stock returns and improving the code

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine trends within the kickstarter campaign industry, specifically for theaters and plays. 
There are a few ways in which we will examine these trends in this analysis. 
One is to evaluate and compare how well campaigns performed based on the time of year when they were launched. 
A second evaluation will examine percentages that were successful versus those that failed or canceled in comparison to initial financial goals set. 
Two questions when examining this data will be to see if any trends exist as to what time of year a campaign launches as to how successful it may be and the other question will ask if there is a trend in how well a campaign performs compared to how lofty of a revenue goal it set.
